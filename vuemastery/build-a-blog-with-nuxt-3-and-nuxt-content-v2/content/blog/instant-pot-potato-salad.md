    -   1 tbsp (15ml) rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar
    -   4 cups (1L) cold tap water

**When instant pot is done**

-   Quick Release.
-   Check potato cubes to ensure they're cooked to your preferred firmness.
-   Place hard boiled eggs in cold water
-   Drain the potatoes with a colander.
-   Gently layer the potatoes on a large tray.
-   Drizzle the potatoes with 2 tbsp (30ml) rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar while hot.
-   Let the potatoes cool for 30 minutes.
-   Finely chop the hard boiled eggs once they're cool to touch.

**Make Salad Dressing:**

-   In a large mixing bowl, add
    -   1 cup (250ml) mayonnaise,
    -   finely diced ingredients (red onion, pickle, eggs and celery), finely chopped hard boiled eggs,
    -   1 tbsp (15g) whole grain mustard,
    -   1 tbsp (15ml) rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar
    -   ½ tsp garlic powder.
-   Mix well with a silicone spatula.
-   Gently fold in the cooled potatoes with a silicone spatula.
-   Taste the salad and season with more kosher salt & fresh ground black pepper to taste.

**Tip #1:** Don’t overmix because you don’t want the potato salad to be too mushy.

**Tip #2:** You'll want the potato salad to be a little on the salty side because putting it in refrigerator will decrease the perception of seasoning.

Cover and place potato salad in refrigerator for at least 3 hours. The potatoes will harden a little once they are cooled.

**Serve:** Serve tasty potato salad cold or at room temperature as a side dish.
