---

Prep Time: 25 minutes

Cook Time: 15 minutes

Servings: 12

## Ingredients

-   3 teaspoons sesame oil divided (or olive oil)
-   1 pound (453g) ground chicken (or ground turkey or pork)
-   1 teaspoon minced garlic
-   1 teaspoon minced ginger
-   3 1/2 cups (350g) shredded green cabbage
-   4 green onions sliced
-   1 tablespoon soy sauce
-   1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar or lime juice)
-   12 egg roll wrappers
-   1 beaten egg (to use for sealing the wrappers)

## Instructions

### How To Make Air Fryer Egg Rolls

-   Add 2 teaspoons of oil to a skillet and cook the ground chicken until done.
-   Add in the ginger and garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds, or until fragrant.
-   Toss in the chopped cabbage and green onions. Cook until the cabbage has wilted which takes about 4-5 minutes.
-   Drizzle the soy sauce and vinegar into the mixture, toss to combine, and then turn off the heat.

### Wrap Egg Rolls

-   Spread your egg roll wrapper out flat, with one corner pointed toward you.
-   Place approximately 3 tablespoons of filling just below the center of the egg roll wrapper.
-   Fold two opposite corners together to make a triangle, then fold the sides in and roll tightly.
-   Dab a small amount of the beaten egg to seal the edges closed.
-   Repeat this process to assemble the rest of the egg rolls.
-   Brush or spray the remaining oil onto each one before cooking.

### Air Fry

-   Spray the Instant Pot insert with a non-stick cooking spray.

-   Add the egg rolls with the seam side facing is down, in a single layer.

-   Be sure to leave space so the air can get in between them to cook evenly.

-   Place the air fryer lid on the Instant Pot and cook for 16-19 minutes, turning egg rolls over halfway through the cooking time.

-   Egg rolls are done when they are golden brown and crispy.

### Cooking In Oven

-   Preheat the oven to 400F / 204C.

-   Add parchment paper to a baking sheet and spray with oil lightly.

-   Put the egg rolls on the baking sheet, making sure to place them seam side down. Bake for 15-18 minutes or until they are a golden brown color.

-   Serve with your favorite dipping sauce or soy sauce and enjoy!

## Notes

-   Don't put too much filling in the egg rolls, or they won't close properly.
-   Make sure to keep the egg roll wrappers covered with a damp cloth so they do not dry out during preparation.
-   Brushing or spraying with oil ensures that the egg rolls will turn out nice and crispy.
-   Do not stack the egg rolls when cooking. Make sure to keep them in a single layer with space for the air to circulate around each one.
-   Please remember to flip the egg rolls halfway through the cooking time so they cook evenly.
